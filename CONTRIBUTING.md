# Contribution Guidelines

Pull requests are welcome but are subject to approval of the maintainers before merge. Although the colour scheme is a bit monotonous, future plans include having the ability to change the colour schemes and have custome config files. It is highly suggested to follow the [pull request template](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository) to ensure quality submissions.

This project can be used as a hands-on learning platform for all people who are looking to enter full stack web development. This is to further request all the contributors to be considerate about the kind of PR's/issues you end up replying to. In case of any discrepancies, the owner of the repository must be contacted. Final decisions of merge(s)/conflicts are upto [@MarkVI2](https://github.com/MarkVI2).
