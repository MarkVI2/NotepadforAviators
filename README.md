# Notepad for Aviators

Notepad for Aviators is a notepad specifically to cater the needs of aviators
looking to jot down information during flight. The web app can be used for both
real flights and virtual simulations.

## Usage and Features

The notepad is supposed to auto-populate information like departure frequencies,
arrival frequencies, runway information, aircraft performance and more (See
[issues](https://github.com/MarkVI2/NotepadforAviators-hacktober/issues) for
features/bugs to be added or before opening a new issue. To request new
features, refer to issue template).

## Contributing

@MarkVI2 will try to update issues or feature requests as soon as possible.
Frameworks being used are **Next.js** with **Typescript**, **MongoDB** for
flight information storage per person, and **Python** for any backend
processing. The primary way to contribute is to look under an issue for the
issue description and try to fix/add that particular bug/feature. In case of new
ideas, you may approach me on discord (aviator_gator). Refer to
